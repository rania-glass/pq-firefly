BattleShip OOP Practice
---

## Intro
This is designed as additional practice with OOP design and calling object methods from the main method.

## Problem Description
Design a system of classes that allow the user to build a Spaceship, add crew members, and battle the spaceships against each other.

## Solution Description
There should be at least two spaceships. Each spaceship should have an attack and a defense value that are equal to the sum of the attack and defense values of all of that ship's crew members. In a battle, the ship that recieves the least damage should emerge as victorious.
